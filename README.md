## Web Scraper

## Description

This script is a simple web scraper built in Python, designed to scrape sneaker release images from 'sneakerjagers.com'. It uses the requests library to send HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup from bs4 for parsing HTML content.

## Features

- Scrapes images from a specified sneaker release webpage.
- Saves images locally in an 'images' directory.
- Compatible with different operating systems as it checks the OS type.
## Getting Started

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- BeautifulSoup4
- Requests
You can install the required packages using:


pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
## Installing
Clone this repository or download the script to your local machine.
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
## Executing Program
Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script:


python scraper.py
Images will be downloaded and stored in the 'images' directory within the same folder as the script.
How It Works

The script makes an HTTP GET request to 'https://www.sneakerjagers.com/en/releases'. It then parses the HTML content to extract all image URLs and downloads each image, saving them to the 'images' directory.

## Customization

You can modify the URL in the script to scrape images from different web pages.
Ensure the website allows web scraping to respect legal and ethical considerations.
